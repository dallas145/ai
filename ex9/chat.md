Prompt: 
How to pronounce "hail" in German?

Response: 
In German, the pronunciation of "Hale" is actually very different from the English word "hail"!

In German, "Hai" (note the single "i", not double "i" like in English) is pronounced as:

* " Hai" (HA-ee)

The vowel sound is more like the "ee" in "meet", and the "H" is pronounced more like a soft "ch" or a gentle blowing of air. Try saying "ch-ee" with a soft "ch" sound.

So, to summarize:

English "hail" = HAYL
German "Hail" (Hai) = HA-ee

Hoffentlich (hopefully) this helps!
